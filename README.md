# Implementation of PageRank Algorithm in C++ (Early Stage)

> Just for fun, I was bored. (okay so i think i made something which works pretty nice)

## About The Project

This is a very primitive implementation of the famous PageRank algorithm, that's basically ranking pages to provide relevant results in response to a web search- so that we don't have to find for the thing we are looking for like a maniac (makes life easier T_T ).

## Getting Started

To compile and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler (like `g++`) installed on your system. And also a python compiler to see the magic of the webscraper.py script which is explained later (idk why I named it webscraper, shud have named it webcrawler only, would have sounded kool) .

### Machinery

* A Laptop where u can run C++ and Python in VScode.

### Compilation and Execution

1.  Clone the repository or download the source files into a single directory.

2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source files (`main.cpp`, `matrixhelpers.cpp`, `pagerank.cpp`).

3.  If you want to test something in general like a small graph, you can use the `input.txt` to give the input to this pipeline. The output will automatically be stored in the `results.txt` for hardcoded sample inputs just make sure to change the paths in `main.cpp` in this line 
                        ```bash
                           string input_file = "../data/input_filename.txt";
                           string output_file = "../results/output_filename.txt";
                        ```

4.  Now here comes the `webscraper.py`, this file is nothing but an automated graph constructor which can construct a directed graph by tracing all the hyperlinks from a source website. Whatever website you want to use, you just need to follow 3 simple tweaks to construct the hyperlink graph and store it inside the `var_grph.txt` and also store all the unqiue links which are the nodes in the graph in the `urls.txt`. Now for using any random website just see the last line of the `webscrapper.py` i.e.
    ```bash
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        crawl_website("https://tumahara_url.com/", max_pages=x, max_depth=y)
    ```
Change the attributes inside the crawl_website function and boom, it's done !

5.  Compile all the source files together using the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp matrixhelpers.cpp pagerank.cpp -I "../includes" -o pagerank_app
    ```

6.  Run the generated executable:
    ```bash
    ./pagerank_app
    ``` 
7.  Results will be stored in the respective .txt files as u have defined in the path .


## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! I plan to make it better iteratively. :))
