# Implementation of PageRank Algorithm in C++ (Early Stage)

> Just for fun, I was bored.

## About The Project

This is a simple, from-scratch implementation of the PageRank algorithm in C++. The project is currently in its initial development phase, focusing on getting the core logic and matrix operations working correctly.

## Getting Started

To compile and run this project, you will need a C++ compiler (like `g++`) installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang)

### Compilation and Execution

1.  Clone the repository or download the source files into a single directory.

2.  Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source files (`main.cpp`, `matrixhelpers.cpp`, `pagerank.cpp`).

3.  Compile all the source files together using the following command:
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp matrixhelpers.cpp pagerank.cpp -o myprogram
    ```

4.  Run the generated executable:
    ```bash
    ./myprogram
    ```

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! I plan to make it better iteratively. :))
